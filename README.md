# Udemy-Web-Dev-Bootcamp----REST-Blog
Small "blog" app for practice with mongoDB/mongoose, express, and RESTful routing.
Hosted on heroku here: https://sheltered-peak-22386.herokuapp.com

Does not have any sort of authentication or authorization, as such, literally anyone can make any post they want, or delete or edit any existing post.
Luckily, since I'm a nobody this shouldn't be a problem.

These problems are all addressed on the larger app YelpCamp, also made during the bootcamp. This app was built as sort of a stepping stone to make the YelpCamp app.
